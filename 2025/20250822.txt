#NEXUS AND EXPLOSIVE MODERNITY

I'm reading almost in comparison Harari's Nexus and Illouz's Explosive Modernity. I feel there are connection points between the two, like two different historians holding the same megaphone but yelling from opposite ends. 
Illouz argues that modern life is contradictory: we’re promised freedom, self-expression, and progress, but the same systems that promise this also generate precarity, fragmentation, and emotional burnout. 
Harari’s Nexus is basically saying: none of this is random. Information networks—religious dogmas, bureaucracies, newspapers, Facebook, TikTok, AI models—are the invisible plumbing that makes modernity “explode.” They decide which promises get amplified and which anxieties get manufactured.
One book is laying down the symptoms, the other is giving the infrastructure: how the networks of information have historically created these very symptoms.
