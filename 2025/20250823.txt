#DOPAMINE

Lately I feel like a full-blown dopamine junkie. My phone use is out of control, every pause instantly filled with scrolling. The only antidote I can see is slowing down.
I don’t need to react to every moment or stuff every second with noise. Even this journal is a way of filling space, but at least it feels healthier than doomscrolling.
So: slow.  
One thing at a time.  

Here are a few things I should start doing *without* my phone:  
- bathroom  
- reading  
- watching a video  
- listening to music  
- sleeping  
And I’m sure there’s plenty more I haven’t noticed yet.
