#SEPTEMBER

September is usually the month of “new beginnings,” of good resolutions. Not for me, not this time. Unlike every past January and September, I don’t have any today—because what I’m working on is a lifestyle rooted in my true identity. It’s an everyday commitment, so nothing magically changes just because it’s September 1st.
