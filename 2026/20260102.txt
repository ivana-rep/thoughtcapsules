Obsession is usually framed as a flaw, something unhealthy, something to fix.
But for some people, [obsession is how work gets done](https://ivana-rep.github.io/thoughtcapsules/post.html?p=2026/20260116.txt).
Structure, routines, relentless focus on objectives.
Maybe the problem isn’t obsession itself, but leaving it unmanaged.
I want to learn how to turn obsession into a tool, not a liability.
