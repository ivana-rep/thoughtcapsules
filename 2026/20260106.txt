No particular anxiety.
Just a different mental state, one that rarely shows up on days like these.
I want to notice it, not waste it.
This is for rest and preparation.
For planning.
For building systems.
This is the state where a [plan](post.html#2026/20260107.txt) should be built, not executed.
This state isn’t for action. It’s for recovery.
Skipping it only sends the mind back to autopilot.
