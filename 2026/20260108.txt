I used to dismiss most advice from online “wellness gurus” as fake.
Too obvious to be useful.
Then I realized the problem wasn’t the advice. It was my impatience.
Writing things down sounds trivial until you do it for months.
Taking a few deep breaths sounds naïve until it actually calms you down.
Simple doesn’t mean ineffective.
It means it works only if you’re consistent.
