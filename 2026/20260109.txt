The tip I hate the most is “just do it.”
If it were easy, it wouldn’t be advice.

Then comes the follow-up: “make it so small you can’t fail.”
Reasonable. Logical.
Useless when your brain refuses to start at all.

Sometimes there’s a real block.
Not laziness. Not lack of strategy. A wall.

It’s hard to admit, but that wall often breaks only at the bottom.
When avoidance runs out of room.

There’s no clever workaround for that.
The way out of suffering is through it.
