The tip I hate the most is “just do it.”
If it were easy, it wouldn’t be advice.
Then comes the follow-up: “make it so small you can’t fail.”
Reasonable. Logical.
Useless when your brain refuses to start at all.
Sometimes there’s a real block.
Not laziness. Not lack of strategy. A wall.
It’s hard to admit, but that wall often breaks only at the bottom.
When avoidance runs out of room.
There’s no clever workaround for that.
