I read this sentence:
!!The problem starts when short-term relief creates long-term damage!!
It’s concise.
It’s accurate.
And it hits harder than expected.
Framing relief this way changes how you see it.
Relief is what [autopilot](post.html?p=2026/20260116.txt) optimizes for.
It explains why the [brain](post.html?p=2026/20260115.txt) keeps choosing damage over discomfort.
[Boredom](post.html?p=2026/20260113.txt) makes that trade tempting.
