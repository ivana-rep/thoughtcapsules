A task surfaced on my work to-do list.
For a moment, it felt heavy.
Too demanding. Too complicated. Not now.
[Somehow, I started anyway](https://ivana-rep.github.io/thoughtcapsules/post.html?p=2026/20260108.txt).
It was brief.
It was manageable.
Now it’s done.
I feel lighter.
This is worth remembering.
This wasn’t motivation.
It was going [through](post.html#2026/20260109.txt) resistance with a small enough step.
That’s what a usable [plan](post.html#2026/20260107.txt) looks like.
