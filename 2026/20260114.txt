Social interactions drain me.
Sometimes I push through so I don’t lose every connection.
!!But the cost is real!!.
They take me down to zero.
Selection matters.
Still, there are days when even a few is too much.
After that depletion, [boredom](post.html#2026/20260113.txt) hits harder.
[Anxiety](post.html#2026/20260106.txt) follows when recovery doesn’t happen.
