I’m scared of how easily my brain slips into [autopilot](https://ivana-rep.github.io/thoughtcapsules/post.html?p=2026/20260116.txt).
Once it’s on, stopping feels impossible.
It doesn’t matter how harmful the behavior is,
or how much it will hurt future me.
The brain just goes.
It’s not choosing what’s good.
It’s choosing what brings [relief](post.html#2026/20260111.txt) fastest.
The [damage](post.html#2026/20260101.txt) only becomes obvious later.
