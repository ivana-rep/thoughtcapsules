I [keep thinking](https://ivana-rep.github.io/thoughtcapsules/post.html?p=2026/20260115.txt) about autopilot.
It’s unsettling how powerful it is, and how trapped it can make you feel.
Some people run it toward good behaviors.
Others toward self-destruction.
The mechanism is the same.
Only the direction changes.
[Obsession](post.html#2026/20260102.txt) is autopilot with a target.
It reduces the number of [decisions](post.html#2026/20260110.txt) you have to face.
But what it runs toward is usually [relief](post.html#2026/20260111.txt).
