I believe [this project](index.html) shows how much I'm into logging. 
I'm trying to keep it easy and not to [be obsessed](post.html#2026/20260116.txt) about this habit.
So far I'm logging readings and this journal. I love it to be honest. It keeps me grounded.
No wonder why days derail when I don't log.
It has become a keystone habit.
