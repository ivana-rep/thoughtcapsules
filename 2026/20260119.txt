!!Anger!! has to be converted into [obsession](2026/20260102.txt).
It’s not arrogance to believe you can do better than they ever will.
But [belief](2026/20260103.txt) means nothing without behavior.
No speeches.
No explanations.
Just !!consistent!! action.
They’ll notice. They always do.
You become better.
And they’re forced to confront where they stand.
