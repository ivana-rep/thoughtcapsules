[Anger](2026/20260119.txt) keeps coming back as a topic.
It’s a feeling that’s often present, and it tends to trigger much more than itself.
I’ve always thought of it as energy. Something to use.
Reading [Gregory B. Sadler](https://open.substack.com/pub/gregorybsadler/p/3-philosophers-walk-into-a-bar-fight) made me reconsider that framing.
In what I wrote before, I said: “They’ll notice. They always do.”
That’s where I was wrong.
As long as anger feeds on something external, recognition, comparison, imagined judgment, it can’t be redirected into anything genuinely constructive.
Sadler talks about managing anger.
I try to use it.
But if the direction is outward, it’s still misplaced.
The correct direction is inward: channel anger into something positive !!for you!!, not for anyone else.
I still believe this is true: action kills anger by consumption.
But the !!focus!! matters.
The action can’t be aimed at impressing, proving, or confronting others.
The only valid target is future me.
