[I wrote](2026/post.html?p=20260119.txt): “It’s not arrogance to believe you can do better than they ever will.”
Is this actually true?
I’m a Christian. I can’t say I’m at Mass every Sunday, but I do believe.
Is this kind of thinking just a form of !!judgment!!?
Does it turn into judgment, then identity, then a weapon?
A way to condemn others in order to feel right about ourselves?
That would be a mistake, not only as a Christian but by basic common sense.
Being aware of this, and reflecting on it, helps keep that risk in check.
The same problem remains: keeping energy directed inward, not outward in comparison.
