January is the month of commitments: new year brings motivation, momentum.
Bullshit.
There is no such thing as a "new beginning".
New beginnings aren't transformative events, just a sequence of repeated [decisions](post.html?p=2026/20260110.txt).
Real change is !!incremental!!, [boring](post.html?p=2026/20260113.txt).
[Life doesn’t change through plot twists](https://statebene.substack.com/p/106-lanno-nuovo-dieci-anni-fa).
It changes through the !!accumulation of ordinary days!!.
Meaning doesn’t come from the event:
January, September, your birthday, someone dying suddenly.
It comes from !!continuity!!.
