I feel in [control](post.html?p=2026/20260124.txt) when I analyze data.  
But it’s a scam.  
It creates the constant impression of [doing](post.html?p=2026/20260126.txt), without actually moving.  
The problem with data, with overtracking, is that data never describes reality on its own.  
Data must be interpreted.  
Data can tell whatever story you want.  
Data can guide you, but only if you don’t use it against yourself, or to sugarcoat a bad reality.
