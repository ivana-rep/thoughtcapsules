Solomon’s Paradox states that we are good at delivering rational perspectives to others, but also very bad at delivering those same rational perspectives to ourselves. 
True. 
But also a reason to listen to good advices no matter where they come from, and be careful of the ad hominem bias (meaning you dismiss the idea because of who says it, not because of the idea itself).
