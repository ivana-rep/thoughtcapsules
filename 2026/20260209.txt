[Sadler](https://gregorybsadler.substack.com/p/angers-importance-in-the-aristotelian) treats anger as something that must be educated, not eliminated.
In Aristotle, anger isn’t a flaw by default.
It becomes a problem only when it loses proportion, direction, or purpose.
This fits with what I’ve been writing about [anger](post.html?p=2026/20260119.txt) as energy.
Not something to vent.
Not something to suppress.
Something to redirect.
The [risk](post.html?p=2026/20260121.txt) I noted earlier still stands:
as soon as anger needs an external audience, it turns reactive.
It stops serving action and starts feeding identity.
What Aristotle adds, through Sadler, is a constraint:
!!anger is legitimate only when it is aligned with reason and aimed at the right end!!.
Not self-justification.
Not comparison.
Not spectacle.
Anger can fuel action.
But only disciplined action dissolves anger.
!!Used this way, anger doesn’t define you.
It gets consumed.!!
