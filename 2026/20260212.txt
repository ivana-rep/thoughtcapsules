I read an interesting [piece]( https://miniphilosophy.substack.com/p/i-hate-those-people-except-that-one) in the Mini Philosophy newsletter.
It argues that hatred works best when it stays abstract.
We don’t hate people. We hate categories, simplified mental images.
When a category turns into a real person, with a name, a voice, a history, the belief starts to crack.
Reality is harder to compress than ideology.
This explains the gap between what people claim to believe and how they actually live.
Pragmatism captures this well by watching actions rather than declarations.
!!Many profess rigid, exclusive beliefs while practicing inclusive relationships!!.
Not out of virtue, but out of basic humanity.
!!This is how polarized narratives unravel!!.
Society doesn’t hold together because of ideological coherence,
but because of a quiet coexistence built on exceptions and compromises.
To understand the world, it’s more useful to watch how people function in daily life
than to listen to how they describe themselves in ideas.
