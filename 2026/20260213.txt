If it’s meant to be useful, journaling can’t feed rumination.
Awareness without change is just noise.
Rumination on paper is still rumination.
“I felt this or that” is rarely a useful prompt.
Journaling works when it helps spot patterns, separate facts from perception, and untangle narrative from reality.
It should lead to decisions.
Writing !!scenes!! helps.
Analyzing events as if you were a character in a story, not the ruminating version of yourself.
This keeps !!journaling as a tool, not a mirror!!.
