\ Obvious effort is the antithesis of grace
\ Baldassarre Castiglione, Il Cortegiano (The Book of the Courtier, 1528)

If people can see you straining, calculating, or trying to impress, the effect collapses. 
Grace only exists when difficulty is concealed, when mastery looks natural, light, almost accidental.
!!Grace is not laziness. It’s disciplined competence wearing a calm face!!.
Castiglione isn’t praising effortlessness. He’s praising mastery that has outgrown self-consciousness.
Grace is what remains after the work stops being visible.
