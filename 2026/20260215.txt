Sadler makes a [simple point](https://open.substack.com/pub/gregorybsadler/p/dealing-with-messing-up):
if you act seriously, you will mess up.
Mistakes aren’t a verdict on identity, but they’re not nothing either.
What matters is !!responsibility after the fact!!:
recognizing the error, correcting it, integrating it.
Ethical maturity isn’t never failing.
It’s holding the tension between taking responsibility and not destroying yourself for it.
