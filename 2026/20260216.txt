It feels like my interest in [photography](https://www.instagram.com/ivana_dicarlo_/) is channeling more than images.
I may have been using it, unconsciously, to depict solitude and isolation in modern life, through !!architecture, empty spaces, and light!!.
Maybe it’s time to make that intention explicit.
